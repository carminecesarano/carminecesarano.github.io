I am currently a Postdoctoral researcher at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en). I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from University of Naples Federico II.

I work mostly on systems and software security. My research ranges from [software testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12817) and [vulnerability discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05643) to security hardening such as [debloating and secure configuration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11126), as well as runtime enforcement mechanisms including [sandboxing and system-call–level](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11016) policy enforcement. I am also involved in securing and hardening software and AI supply [CHAINS](https://chains.proj.kth.se/).
